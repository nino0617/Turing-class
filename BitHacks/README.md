# [Bit Hacks](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html)

Sean Anderson's wonderful compilation of [Bit Twiddling Hacks](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html), converted to a more readable [Markdown version](BitHacks.md) and accompanying [PDF](BitHacks.pdf).

For a C implementation of some of the Bit Hacks, see Jeroen de Bruijn's repository [here](https://github.com/vidavidorra/BitOperations).

## Note
This is really meant to be viewed as the Markdown source, so you can easily resize the window and interact with the code. I've found the best way to interact with it is either right here on GitHub, or using the [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor and the `markdown-preview` package.

However, a PDF is also included, although currently syntax highlighting is missing until I migrate this to LaTeX.

The PDF was generated using [Markdown to PDF](http://markdowntopdf.com).
